üìò Phase OS Manual Part 8: archive_* Modules

üóÇÔ∏è Purpose

The archive_* modules form Phase OS‚Äôs temporal memory and export layer.

They handle:
	‚Ä¢	Full system snapshots
	‚Ä¢	Weekly digest exports
	‚Ä¢	Difference detection between system states
	‚Ä¢	External sharing of your creative state

This is how your loop gets frozen in time.

üß± Core Components

archive_exporter.py
	‚Ä¢	Role: Backs up system snapshot (focused)
	‚Ä¢	Function:
	‚Ä¢	Archives system metadata, session logs, but excludes heavy .wav and .zip
	‚Ä¢	Outputs: archives/phase_backup_<timestamp>.zip
	‚Ä¢	Use Case: Reliable incremental backups without overload

‚∏ª

phase_os_exporter.py
	‚Ä¢	Role: Full system exporter
	‚Ä¢	Function:
	‚Ä¢	Zips the entire system, including scripts, dashboards, and README
	‚Ä¢	Designed for full migration / versioned clone
	‚Ä¢	Trigger: Run manually or from digest_scheduler.py

‚∏ª

archive_browser.py
	‚Ä¢	Role: Explore past exports
	‚Ä¢	Function:
	‚Ä¢	Lists all past archive files
	‚Ä¢	Lets you diff, open, or mark one for recovery
	‚Ä¢	Status: CLI-first, extendable to web

‚∏ª

archive_diff_summarizer.py
	‚Ä¢	Role: Compare two zip exports
	‚Ä¢	Function:
	‚Ä¢	Unzips, hashes contents
	‚Ä¢	Reports any changed scripts, logs, or data between backups
	‚Ä¢	Diff-like functionality for scaffolds

‚∏ª

digest_scheduler.py
	‚Ä¢	Role: Weekly job controller
	‚Ä¢	Function:
	‚Ä¢	Runs every Sunday at 10:00am (via schedule)
	‚Ä¢	Executes:
	‚Ä¢	Digest generation
	‚Ä¢	Playlist refresh
	‚Ä¢	Oracle seed
	‚Ä¢	Archive export
	‚Ä¢	Phase OS export
	‚Ä¢	Manifest write
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Ensures memory is captured on a fixed rhythm

üß† Why It‚Äôs Powerful
	‚Ä¢	Guarantees no creative memory is lost
	‚Ä¢	Enables rollback to past states (aesthetic + structural)
	‚Ä¢	Facilitates cloning your environment across machines
	‚Ä¢	Can be used as submission proof, audit trail, or versioned release deck

‚∏ª

üí° Tips
	‚Ä¢	Pair archive diffs with builder_form_diff_viewer to see creative + config delta
	‚Ä¢	Add README.md or a human memo to each zip before sharing externally
	‚Ä¢	Use with phase_autostart.py for bootstrapping remote recovery
