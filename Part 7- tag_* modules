📘 Phase OS Manual Part 7: tag_* Modules

🏷️ Purpose

The tag_* modules power Phase OS’s semantic reflection and annotation layer. They allow you to:
	•	Track emotional or conceptual labels across sessions
	•	Navigate your system by idea instead of date
	•	Loop meaning back into structure

In short: this is how the system remembers what it all meant.

🧭 Core Components

tag_dashboard.py
	•	Role: Web dashboard
	•	Function:
	•	Displays all tags extracted from:
	•	voice_log.md
	•	fragment_index.md
	•	form constraints / session notes
	•	Allows filtering by tag (e.g., see all sessions tagged “melancholy”)
	•	Links to voice recordings, sample slices, form maps
	•	Served at: http://localhost:7870

⸻

tag_reflector_link.py
	•	Role: Semantic index builder
	•	Function:
	•	Reads voice_context_stream, fragment logs, moodboards
	•	Builds a linked tag index → tag_index.md
	•	Includes links to:
	•	sessions
	•	samples
	•	visuals
	•	Run Automatically: During Generator and Builder phases

📁 Output Example

# Tag Index

## anxiety
- [2025-06-01 Generator] → moodboard
- [session_2025-0601_1042] → hiss_loop.wav

## longing
- [session_2025-0601_1112] → voice memo log: “I miss the noise of machines.”

🧠 Why It’s Powerful
	•	Mirrors your themes across time
	•	Lets you recall creative fragments by emotion
	•	Surfaces aesthetic patterns you didn’t consciously track
	•	Enables query-based memory navigation (“What else did I say about memory loops?”)

⸻

💡 Tips
	•	Use this as a tag-based playlist tool (“Play all samples tagged winter”)
	•	Merge tags from different modalities (voice, form, texture)
	•	Let this index inform next phase choice (“Return to Builder when ‘resolve’ tag is present”)
