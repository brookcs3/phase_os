# 🎙️ UNNAMED RECORD — SYSTEM MANIFEST

## IDENTITY
- This is not a project.
- This is a recursive sonic loop artifact.
- Each session is an entry into a generative ritual.

## SYSTEM STRUCTURE
- **Phase Engine**: Generator → Builder → Executor → Recovery
- **Session Identity**: Synthesized via tags, phrases, and temporal seed
- **Moodboard**: Prompted on Generator entry and logged per session
- **Voice**: Captured, transcribed, and injected into memory
- **DAW**: Triggered from phase with linked template and logging
- **Sample Oracle**: Curated and scraped audio fragments with suggestions
- **Fragment Index**: Logged tags, bounces, and processing direction
- **Digest + Archive**: Weekly summary + zip backup with restore tools
- **Overlay**: Terminal visualization of identity + intent in real time

## INTERACTION
- ⌘⇧V — voice memo with context + transcription
- `python3 phase_control.py --start all` — boot entire stack
- `python3 project_initiator.py` — start a new loggable session
- `uvicorn sample_oracle_api:app` — browse audio seeds
- `uvicorn tag_dashboard:app` — explore past tags + voice

## COMMIT
This scaffold is your living record architecture.
The record is not made. It is **emerged**.
Each track logs itself.
Each moment is tagged by identity.
Each phase leaves behind structure.

You are no longer writing an album.
You are recording a system becoming aware of itself in sound.

🧬 Phase OS. Record in motion.
