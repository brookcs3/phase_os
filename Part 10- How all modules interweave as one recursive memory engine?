📘 Phase OS Manual Part 10: System Integration — The Recursive Memory Engine

🧬 Purpose

This section explains how every phase_os subsystem — from Oracle scrapers to bounce trackers — is not just modular, but woven together into a self-learning, phase-aware memory machine.

Each part listens to or triggers the others. Together, they behave like a neural circuit of creative cognition.

⸻

🔄 The Cycle of Operation

1. Phase Selection (The Cognitive Switch)
	•	Triggered manually via phase_control.py
	•	Logged into current_phase.txt
	•	Detected by phase_trigger_engine.py
	•	Spawns associated payloads: session init, overlay, dashboard, builder tools

⸻

2. Oracle Activation (Perception + Curation)
	•	In Generator phase:
	•	oracle_auto_scraper.py or oracle_seed_engine.py pulls audio
	•	oracle_curator_ui.py prompts mindful sample decisions
	•	Saved samples lead to oracle_wave_editor.html → trim → oracle_slice_logger.py
	•	Screen captured by oracle_slice_visual_logger.py

⸻

3. Session Identity + Overlay
	•	session_identity_generator.py creates entropy-driven ID (mood, tag, timestamp)
	•	session_overlay.py displays it alongside phase in terminal
	•	Used to name exports, track tags, and contextualize fragments

⸻

4. Tag + Voice Reflection
	•	voice_hotkey.py or voice_memo_logger.py captures voice
	•	voice_transcriber.py + voice_context_stream.py extract semantic meaning
	•	tag_reflector_link.py compiles and indexes semantic tags
	•	tag_dashboard.py visualizes your recurring themes

⸻

5. Builder Feedback Loop
	•	Entering Builder phase triggers:
	•	oracle_remix_session.py to gather saved slices
	•	builder_form_map_generator.py to create arrangement blueprint
	•	builder_form_versioner.py to version form intent
	•	form_diff_viewer.py to show what changed from last session
	•	remix_browser.py to preview your curated past

⸻

6. Loop Completion + Digesting
	•	loop_compiler.py scans bounces
	•	loop_visualizer.py plots structure + form overlay
	•	loop_digest.py summarizes session output
	•	digest_scheduler.py runs this weekly along with archive_exporter.py

⸻

7. Archival + Export
	•	phase_os_exporter.py creates total zip snapshot
	•	archive_diff_summarizer.py compares two exports
	•	archive_browser.py enables manual recovery
	•	README.md and record_scaffold_manifest.md are generated via manifest_writer.py

🧠 The Model: Memory Through Interaction

Every module:
	•	Writes to disk (visual, text, audio, tag)
	•	Informs the next phase
	•	Forms a thread in the memory loop

🔁 Loop Looks Like This:

[You speak] → voice_transcriber.py
       ↓
[Tag created] → tag_reflector_link.py
       ↓
[Used to bias Oracle search] → oracle_search_terms.py
       ↓
[Slice saved] → oracle_slice_logger.py
       ↓
[Added to remix session] → oracle_remix_session.py
       ↓
[Form generated] → builder_form_map_generator.py
       ↓
[Bounce tracked] → loop_compiler.py
       ↓
[Logged in digest + archived]


⸻

🧠 Summary: Why It Works
	•	🔒 Memory is phase-linked and identity-stamped
	•	🔄 Feedback loops are enforced — every input becomes output
	•	🧠 Reflection is structural — not just inspirational
	•	💽 Sessions become artifacts — not just folders
	•	🧠 The system grows with you — by design, not inference

You’ve now completed the Phase OS Manual.

This isn’t just an automation system. This is your recursive assistant.
A mind you grow from the outside in.
A voice that remembers.
A loop that learns you.
